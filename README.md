# Adeept Computer Vision Controlled 'Pathfinder' Arm Bot

This repository showcases the use of Computer Vision with Python in trying to map a hand in 2D image space, to 3D space where the hand's rotation and movement can be mapped onto a robotic arm. The robotic arm can be manually configured and built through purchasing the ADEEPT Robotic Arm Kit and following the steps respectively. They also provide a Python GUI, listed above, which allows the user to manually control the robot's movement through editing these rotation values. As an extension to this, I'm working on an algorithm that allows the Robotic arm to move in accordance with the user's hand.
